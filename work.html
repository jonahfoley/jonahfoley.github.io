                <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                <p>This project formed my BEng (Part 3) dissertation while at The University of Southampton. In this report we investigate the use of index modulation to tackle the peak-to-average-power ratio problems of OFDM systems. By means of simulation we show that a range of schemes can be employed to balance throughput and power, making the technique suitable for a range of wireless environments.</p>

                <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                <p>FSM.io is a command line application which converts draw.io representations of finite state machines to synthesisable SystemVerilog. This project was written in C++, and its function can be broken down into four stages: (1) decoding the drawio XML representation, (2) parsing the XML into tokens, (3) building a binary tree representation of the state machine, and (4) converting the tree representation to SystemVerilog.</p>

                <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                <p>This project demonstrates the Implementation of an embedded CPU which executes a custom instruction set to perform affine transforms. The goal of the design was to minimise power consumption, measured by means of ALM utilisation (targeting an Intel Cyclone V FPGA), with the final implementation requiring just 21.</p>
